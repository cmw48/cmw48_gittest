This is a readme file for the fictional GIT project we are starting.

There haven't been any revisions to this file.

Update: I didn't know it before, but you can annotate any part of your code, and then highlight it 

using the following URL (customized for your code): 

https://github.com/[user]/[repo]/blob/[branch]/[OPT-folder?]/[filename]#L[from line]-[to line]

Now you can highlight a specific section of any code in any repo on github!  

I can see where this would be super useful for pointing out problems

as in, "Hey, dumbass-- have another look at this section of code."

Like this!
